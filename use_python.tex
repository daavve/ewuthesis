PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE\\
\\
Python is a fully-featured high-level language. It has very mature image, machine learning, and scientific libraries.  I chose Python because of it's minimalist syntax and batteries-included nature.  Python also does not require compilation, which speeds development.





Why not Java:  Java is a very good language. However, I found myself writing my own libraries for basic image processing / manipulation tasks.  Also Java does not integrate easily with C++ or Python.

Why no C/C++?:    A large base of image processing and scientific libraries exist for C++, and the language is very widely used.  However C++ is challanging to learn, and I found myself overwhelmed by the sheer scope of the language.
