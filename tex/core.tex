Fundamental problems I am pursuing & overall progress of problems pursued.



1)  Peer-Review:
    Question:  Confirm work presented in CADAL website accurately matches CADAL paper.
    Motivation:  Incidental to work on character similarity work, and character segmentation work.



2)  Character segmentation:
    Question:  How well can computer differentiate characters in classical calligraphic works?


3)  Character comparison (Kosuke's Task):
    Question:   Given a Calligraphic work featuring a collection of characters hand-copied from a variety of parent works.
                For any given Character of the collection,.... can we find the character it is supposed to be a copy of.
