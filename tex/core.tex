Fundamental problems I am pursuing & overall progress of problems pursued.



3)  Character comparison (Kosuke's Task):
    Question:   Given a Calligraphic work <Kosuke's book> featuring a collection of characters hand-copied from a variety of parent works.
                Given that none of the origionals exist, and that both Kosuke's book as well as the parent works we have available are hand copied one or more times from the origionals.
                For any given Character in Kosuke's book, can we determine the source character from which it was copied from?
                






Why people might find this important:
    *  The character's in Kosuke's are considered the "best" examples of calligraphy by Wang-Xu.
    *  Understanding which source documents contributed to this book would yeild a deeper understanding of which scripts contributed most strongly to this collection of exemplar characters.
    
Chalanges:
    *  Our samples are incomplete.
        + We may not have copies of all source works
        + Of the source works we do have, not all characters are currently in a format giving us easy comparison.


Process:  What I had to do:
    1)  Get together a colletion of characters origionally written by 王羲之.
    2)  Scan Kosuke's book
    3)  Find what characters are in Kosuke's book, as well as find the bounding box of each character.
    
What I found:
    1)  There exist two databases which have segmented characters written by 王羲之.
    2)  CADAL, and Other guys < never was able to get in touch with other guys >
    3)  Searching CADAL did not give me good enough results.
    3.5)  One of the CADAL researcher got back to me, but I wasn't able to get the info I needed from him / her.


1)  Peer-Review:
    Question:  Confirm work presented in CADAL website accurately matches CADAL paper.
    Motivation:  Incidental to work on character similarity work, and character segmentation work.



2)  Character segmentation:
    Question:  How well can computer differentiate characters in classical calligraphic works?
    
Why the website?
    * Accessable to anyone who uses the internet.
    * Provide  a platform to which many people can contribute to.
    * Cowd-sourcing oportunities for segmentation work.
        +Why we need croud-sourcing? <number of unsegmented results, humans still better at this visual task>




what we have:
    Problem:
    
    Data aquisition
    
    Data Synthesis
    
    Data Analysis
    
    Data evaluation
