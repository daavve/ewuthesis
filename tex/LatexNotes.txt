\subsection*{Introduction}
All the divisional commands from \part* to \subparagraph* have this "starred" version which can be used on special occasions for an unnumbered heading when the setting of secnumdepth would normally mean it would be numbered.

If you want the unnumbered section to be in the table of contents anyway, use the \addcontentsline command like this:

\section*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}
Note that if you use PDF bookmarks you will need to add a phantom section so that bookmark will lead to the correct place in the document. The \phantomsection command is defined in the hyperref package, and is implemented normally as follows:

\phantomsection
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}
\section*{Introduction}
For chapters you will also need to clear the page (this will also correct page numbering in the ToC):

\cleardoublepage
\phantomsection
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}
\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
\bibliography{my_bib_file}


The commands \listoffigures and \listoftables work in exactly the same way as \tableofcontents to automatically list all your tables and figures. If you use them, they normally go after the \tableofcontents command. The \tableofcontents command normally shows only numbered section headings, and only down to the level defined by the tocdepth counter, but you can add extra entries with the \addcontentsline command. For example if you use an unnumbered section heading command to start a preliminary piece of text like a Foreword or Preface, you can write:

Book structure[edit]
The standard LaTeX book class follows the same layout described above with some additions. By default a book will be two-sided, i.e. left and right margins will change according to the page number parity. Furthermore current chapter and section will be printed in the header.

If you do not make use of chapters, it is barely useful to use the book class.

Additionally the class provides macros to change the formatting of some places of the document. We will give you some advice on how to use them properly.[1]

\begin{document}
\frontmatter

\maketitle

% Introductory chapters
\chapter{Preface}
% ...

\mainmatter
\chapter{First chapter}
% ...

\appendix
\chapter{First Appendix}

\backmatter
\chapter{Last note}
The frontmatter chapters will not be numbered. Page numbers will be printed in roman numerals. Frontmatter is not supposed to have sections, since they will be number 0.n because there is no chapter numbering. Check the Counters chapter for a fix.
The mainmatter chapters works as usual. The command resets the page numbering. Page numbers will be printed in arabic numerals.
The \appendix macro can be used to indicate that following sections or chapters are to be numbered as appendices. Appendices can be used for the article class too:
\appendix
\section{First Appendix}
Only use the \appendix macro once for all appendices.

The backmatter behaves like the frontmatter. It has the same issue with section numbering.
As a general rule you should avoid mixing the command order. Nonetheless all commands are optional, so you might consider using only a few.

Note that the special content like the table of contents is considered as an unnumbered chapter.

Page order[edit]
This is one traditional page order for books.

Frontmatter
Half-title
Empty
Title page
Information (copyright notice, ISBN, etc.)
Dedication if any, else empty
Table of contents
List of figures (can be in the backmatter too)
Preface chapter
Mainmatter
Main topic
Appendix
Some subordinate chapters
Backmatter
Bibliography
Glossary / Index

Citations[edit]
To actually cite a given document is very easy. Go to the point where you want the citation to appear, and use the following: \cite{cite_key}, where the cite_key is that of the bibitem you wish to cite. When LaTeX processes the document, the citation will be cross-referenced with the bibitems and replaced with the appropriate number citation. The advantage here, once again, is that LaTeX looks after the numbering for you. If it were totally manual, then adding or removing a reference would be a real chore, as you would have to re-number all the citations by hand.

Instead of WYSIWYG editors, typesetting systems like \TeX{} or \LaTeX{} \cite{lamport94} can be used.
Referring more specifically[edit]
Sometimes you want to refer to a certain page, figure or theorem in a text book. For that you can use the arguments to the \cite command:

\cite[p.~215]{citation01}
The argument, "p. 215", will show up inside the same brackets. Note the tilde in [p.~215], which replaces the end-of-sentence spacing with a non-breakable inter-word space. There are two reasons: end-of-sentence spacing is too wide, and "p." should not be separated from the page number.

Multiple citations[edit]
When a sequence of multiple citations are needed, you should use a single \cite{} command. The citations are then separated by commas. Note that you must not use spaces between the citations. Here's an example:

\cite{citation01,citation02,citation03}
The result will then be shown as citations inside the same brackets.


LaTeX provides an environment called thebibliography that you have to use where you want the bibliography; that usually means at the very end of your document, just before the \end{document} command. Here is a practical example:

\begin{thebibliography}{9}

\bibitem{lamport94}
  Leslie Lamport,
  \emph{\LaTeX: a document preparation system},
  Addison Wesley, Massachusetts,
  2nd edition,
  1994.

\end{thebibliography}
