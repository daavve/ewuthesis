\chapter{Introduction}

A trainable classifier is a mathematical or algorithmic model can be used to make predictions on data not seen before.

Classifiers are used in a variety of areas like recommender systems, such as Netflix, to weather forcasting, to image recognition.

In order for these classifiers to perform well there must be a sufficiently large representative sample of data availiable to train the classifier.


The largest most comprehensive dataset of Anchient Chinese Calligraphy is the CADAL Dataset.

Since the collected characters Stelle and the CADAL Dataset contain information from a similar domain, I hypothesize that a classfier can be trained using that CADAL dataset to detect calligraphic characters in the Collected characters stelle.
