\chapter{Conclusion}

This work built a classifier based on data provided by the CADAL Dataset.

The perforamance of this classifier was evaluated,

I demonstrated the usefullness of the classifier by including the classifier as a part of a character detection algorithm, as well as a component detection algorithm.

The classifier performed poorly due to missing data in the CADAL dataset. 



The work also validated the usefullness of the CADAL dataset in building a classifier.
