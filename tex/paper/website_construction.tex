    * Many historians are not computer savvy, so an interface they are already familiar with may feel more natural to them.
    * Relieves the burden of having to download, install, configure, and debug experimental software.
    * Accessible to anyone who uses the internet.
    * Provide  a platform to which many people can use and contribute to.
