abstract="Recognizing fonts has become an important task in document analysis, due to the increasing number of available digital documents in different fonts and emphases. A generic font recognition system independent of language, script and content is desirable for processing various types of documents. At the same time, categorizing calligraphy styles in handwritten manuscripts is important for paleographic analysis, but has not been studied sufficiently in the literature. We address the font recognition problem as analysis and categorization of textures. We extract features using complex wavelet transform and use support vector machines for classification. Extensive experimental evaluations on different datasets in four languages and comparisons with state-of-the-art studies show that our proposed method achieves higher recognition accuracy while being computationally simpler. Furthermore, on a new dataset generated from Ottoman manuscripts, we show that the proposed method can also be used for categorizing Ottoman calligraphy with high accuracy.",

abstract = {Calligraphic style is considered, for this research, visual attributes of images of calligraphic characters sampled randomly from a "work" created by a single artist. It is independent of page layout or textual content. An experimental design is developed to investigate to what extent the source of a single, or of a few pairs, of character images can be assigned to the either same work or to two different works. The experiments are conducted on the 13,571 segmented and labeled 600-dpi character images of the CADAL database. The classifier is not trained on the works tested, only on other works. Even when only a few samples of same-class pairs are available, the difference-vector of a few simple features extracted from each image of a pair yields over 80\% classification accuracy for a same-work vs. different-work dichotomy. When many pairs of different classes are available for each pair, the accuracy, using the same features, is almost the same. These style-verification experiments are part of our larger goal of style identification and forgery detection.},

pages="633--640",
abstract="As historical Chinese calligraphy works are being digitized, the problem of retrieval becomes a new challenge. But, currently no OCR technique can convert calligraphy character images into text, nor can the existing Handwriting Character Recognition approach does not work for it. This paper proposes a novel approach to efficiently retrieving Chinese calligraphy characters on the basis of similarity: calligraphy character image is represented by a collection of discriminative features, and high retrieval speed with reasonable effectiveness is achieved. First, calligraphy characters that have no possibility similar to the query are filtered out step by step by comparing the character complexity, stroke density and stroke protrusion. Then, similar calligraphy characters are retrieved and ranked according to their matching cost produced by approximate shape match. In order to speed up the retrieval, we employed high dimensional data structure --- PK-tree. Finally, the efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated by a preliminary experiment with 3012 calligraphy character images.",
