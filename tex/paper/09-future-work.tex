    My future work:
        
        *  Create an interface which enables website users to modify existing data on the site.
        *  Use a learning algorithm to "guess" the position of un-annotated characters.
        *  OCR performance on calligraphic characters is abysmal.  Attack this problem
        *  Use a comparison algorithm to "measure" and perhaps draw attention to important similarities / differences between characters.

    Some of this work has already been done by the folks at CADAL, maybe thayed like to share with me.
