ABSTRACT\\

The handwritten character detection problem is mostly solved for latin texts.

Detection of individual chinese calligraphy characters remains difficult due to:
    1)  The thousands of individual characters
    2)  The complex nature of calligraphic styles
    3)  Ancient chinese scripts carry special problems
        3a) The scripts are frequently badly deterioated
        3b) The origionals have been coppied multiple times by many individuals
        
This paper presents an novel application of the Discrete Fourtier Transform(DFT) we call the Fourtier Transform Filter(FTF)

The FTF is effectively a low-pass filter which removes the high-frequency parts of the image.  The resulting "smoothed image" can then be segmented using a hill-climbing algorithm.
