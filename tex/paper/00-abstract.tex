ABSTRACT\\
\\
Calligraphy experts typically must carefully examine minute details in individual characters in the process of determing authenticity.  The large number of Chinese Characters makes finding and comparing similar characters within the same document a difficult and time-consuming process.

I propose a system which makes closely examining related characters intuitive and fast.  I present CaliSet(Calligraphy Dataset).  CaliSet provides the researcher with a high quality zoom-able and navigable image of the work.  Overlay-ed on this image are bounding boxes representing individual characters in the database.  Selecting any of these boxes brings up a carousel of similar images at the bottom of the page.  Selecting any of these characters brings up the source document for that character in a new window, with source character already selected(to-do).
