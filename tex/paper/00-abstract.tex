ABSTRACT\\

The handwritten calligraphic character detection problem is mostly solved for latin texts.

Detection of individual chinese calligraphy characters remains difficult due to the thousands of individual characters as well as the complex nature of calligraphic styles.

Ancient Chinese Calligraphy scripts are frequently badly deteriated, while also having been coppied multiple times by differing authors.

This paper presents an novel application of the Discrete Fourtier Transform(DFT) we call the Fourtier Transform Filter(FTF)

The FTF is effectively a low-pass filter which removes the high-frequency parts of the image.  The resulting "smoothed image" can then be segmented using a hill-climbing algorithm.

The FTF is conceptually less complex than other segmenting algorithms.
