What I was able to do:
    My findings:
        * There exists enough data in the CADAL set to compare many of the same characters, attributed to the same author, across a variety of texts.
        *  Many of the characters encoded in CADAL Calligraphy many characters are single specimens and therefore defy individual comparisons.  The Chinese language contains a vast variety of characters, many of which are used infrequently.
        *  The CADAL character set provides positional data for a only a very small portion: probably less than 10\% of retrieved calligraphy pages.  (Need Statistics here)
        *  Of the pages with CADAL character positional information, a significant portion of the characters present are not reflected in the character database.
