\subsection{JSON}

JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON for short is an intermediate file format which is especially well suited for data interchange for the following reasons

The data formatted in plain text, so it is easily read by either machines or humans.

JSON data is formatted in a simple consistant and flexible way.  Here is an example of a single character formatted in JSON:

\begin{verbatim}
    
{
  "chi_author": "王羲之",
  "chi_mark": "又",
  "chi_work": "兰亭序",
  "page_id": "00000053",
  "work_id": "06100007",
  "xy_coordinates": [
  "102",
  "613",
  "164",
  "662"
  ]
},
\end{verbatim}


You will notice that JSON is very verbose.  Every value stored inside a JSON document is paired with a description of that variable.  This feature makes JSON easily readable and understandable.
