\subsection{Java to Python}

Earlier I mentioned that I made the transition from programing the project primarily in Java, to using Python.  I made the switch because Python provides a more comprehensive set of freely available tools for manipulating and performing data science against images.  Also, because Python is better at interacting with foreign languages than Java, and that developing software is (in my opinion) faster and easier in Python.
