ABSTRACT\\
\\
The field of Document Understanding is a complex and diverse field. Document Understanding deals with a Computer's ability to not just extract text from, but to understand a document. In this case a document is a written work stored in the computer as an image. My current primary focus is on using Document Understanding techniques to try to gain insight into authorship questions regarding Chinese Calligraphy. Ancient Chinese scripts frequently do not have author information included with the work. Authorship of a particular work is neither obvious or straitforward. The primary contribution of this work is to prototype a computational tool which Scientists might consult to make a better decision about authorship of a particular script or character. This technologies aim is primarily to assist an expert in making an authorship judgement on a character-by-character basis.
