The field of Document Understanding is a complex and diverse field.  Document Understanding deals with a Computer's ability to not just extract text from, but to understand a document.  In this case a document is a written work stored in the computer as an image.  My current primary focus is on using Document Understanding techniques to try to gain insight into authorship questions regarding Chinese Calligraphy.  This mission is extremely broad and covers a vast area of overlaping sciences.  This includes, Segmentation:  The ability to differentiate individual characters from each other and from the various noise non-character components of a work(such as printed seals, damage to the document, noise or distortion introduced during the digitization or compression process (as in JPEG.))

My contribution to this field is two-fold

1)  I Scrapped the CADAL Calligraphy project website from there I
    *  Extracted a collection of source documents, with individual characters discriminated by bounding boxes.
    *  These characters contained information on the translation of the individual character, the work, and the author of the work.
